# Intrinsic-Galaxy-Properties
These scripts were used for estimating intrinsic properties semi-resolved high-redshift sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs), for a paper in progress.

You may find detailed descriptions for each script with the code.

These scripts estimate the following properties:
- a modified blackbody FIR/sub-mm spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy;
- dust temperature, dust mass, total infrared luminosity, and star formation rate;
- neutral gas density and FUV field intensity;
- intensity of spectral lines.

These scripts also help visualize these properties and create figures for continuum images and moment maps (i.e., intensity, velocity, dispersion).

The code is specified for my data set, but may easily be changed for any set of extragalactic resolved or semi-resolved galaxies!
